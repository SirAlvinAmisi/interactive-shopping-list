## Overview  

This project involves building an interactive shopping list that enables users to:  
- Add items to the list.  
- Mark items as purchased.  
- Clear all items from the list.  

The application emphasizes JavaScript-based interactivity, reinforcing skills in array management, DOM updates, and event-driven programming.

## Features  

### Core Features  
1. **Add Items:**  
   - Users can add new items to the shopping list via an input field.  

2. **Mark as Purchased:**  
   - Items can be marked as purchased by clicking on them, which visually updates the item's appearance (e.g., strikethrough text or different background color).  

3. **Clear List:**  
   - Users can clear all items from the shopping list with a single button click.  

### Bonus Features  
1. **Edit Items:**  
   - Users can edit existing items in the shopping list.  

2. **Persistence:**  
   - Use local storage to save the list, allowing it to persist even after a page reload.  

---  

## Requirements  

1. **HTML Structure:**  
   - An input field for adding items.  
   - A container to display the list.  
   - Buttons for adding items, marking them as purchased, and clearing the list.  

2. **JavaScript Implementation:**  
   - Maintain the shopping list in a JavaScript array.  
   - Dynamically update the DOM based on user interactions.  
   - Use event listeners for all actions.  

3. **UI Updates:**  
   - Indicate purchased items visually (e.g., strikethrough text, color changes).
